### 🧠 Who I Am (In a Byte)

I'm a curious Computer Science student from Maharashtra who builds stuff that’s **useful, secure, and fun.** Whether it’s a **gesture-controlled system**, a **typing game**, or a **Firebase-secured visitor app**, I love tech that solves real problems.

I’m currently an intern at **Infowareindia**, have played with Python UIs, optimized databases, and improved workflows. I also dabble in **CTFs, blogging**, and explaining hard security concepts like they’re bedtime stories.

### 🛠️ What I Do

- **🌐 Full-Stack Web Development:** React, Node.js, Bootstrap
- **🛡️ Cybersecurity:** Secure coding, vulnerability testing, OSINT
- **🧠 IoT Engineering:** Raspberry Pi, Arduino, sensors
- **📝 Blogging:** Check my posts on security and dev tips!

> 🌟 I’m open to freelance, internships, or collaborative R&D. If you’re building something cool or need a reliable teammate — I’m in!
